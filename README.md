# servus

**servus** is a simple CMS / blogging engine that is fully self-contained within one executable file.

Unlike WordPress, it does not require a database nor a web server that has the capability of executing server-side scripts such as PHP.

While that might sound like SSG, it is not.

Unlike static site generators such as Jekyll, it does not have a build step nor does it require a web server to actually serve the files.

However, the design is heavily influenced by Jekyll and building a web site with **servus** is very similar to building a web site with Jekyll. Except the build step, the need to run nginx and the endless messing around with RubyGems and Docker containers.
